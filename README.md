### Task 1

Add the viewer position (your choice), a projection (your choice) and compute the ModelView and Projection matrices in the JavaScript application. The viewer position and viewing volume should be controllable with buttons, sliders or menus.

#### Solution T1

The viewer position related to the  `eye` position expressed in polar coordinates, that is controlled by the *user* with the:

-   `radius`   -  the distance from the origin;
-   `theta`  and  `phi`  angles  -  characterize the degree of obliqueness;

The **ModelViewMatrix** is computed by:  `modelViewMatrix  = lookAt(eye, at, up);`

-   `at`  -  the point where the camera is looking at;
-   `up`  -  the point that specifies the way your camera is rotated;

-   `LookAt(eye, at, up)`

The viewer volume is controlled by the following parameters:

-   <u>Orthographic Projection</u> case:   `right`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `near`, `far`. 

    -    ![1556478192304](C:\Users\ivanf\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1556478192304.png)

    -   The **Orthographic Projection Matrix** is computed as following:
         `projectionMatrix  =  ortho(left, right, bottom, ytop, zNear, zFar);`  

        -   `ytop`  - to avoid the conflict with the window object member name (`top`) ;

        

-   <u>Orthographic Projection</u> case:   

    -   `fovy`  -  field of view along Y axes;  The angle between the top and bottom planes of the clipping volume;
    -   `aspect`  -   ratio (*width divided by height*) of the projection plane;
    -   `near`  and  `far`;
    -   ![1556480293000](C:\Users\ivanf\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1556480293000.png)
    -    The **Perspective Projection Matrix** is computed as following:
         `projectionMatrix  =  perspective(fovy, aspect, zNear, zFar);`  

    

We send the model-view and the projection matrixes to the vertex shader (VS) with:
`gl.uniformMatrix4fv(modelViewMatrixLoc,  false, flatten(modelViewMatrix));
gl.uniformMatrix4fv(projectionMatrixLoc, false, flatten(projectionMatrix));`



>   Note:  The splitting procedure for the two different projections are explained bellow, in <u>Task 4</u>;   



### Task 2

Include a scaling (uniform, all parameters have the same value) and a translation Matrix and control them with sliders.

#### Solution T2

The translation is controlled by the 3 range sliders (*Translate-X*, *Translate-Y*, *Translate-Z*), one for each axes. 

The scaling is controlled by the *Scale Factor* range slider.

The Translating and Scaling matrixes are declared in the vertex-shaders, after the scale and translation vectors parameters are passed to the shaders (the components of the scale vector are all the same (*uniform scaling*)):

```c
            uniform vec3 t;    // translation vector
            uniform vec3 s;    // scale factor vector

            // This matrices are column-major !!!
            mat4 T = mat4(  1.0,  0.0,  0.0, 0.0,
                            0.0,  1.0,  0.0, 0.0,
                            0.0,  0.0,  1.0, 0.0,
                            t.x,  t.y,  t.z, 1.0 );     // Translation Matrix


            mat4 S = mat4(  s.x,  0.0,  0.0, 0.0,
                            0.0,  s.y,  0.0, 0.0,
                            0.0,  0.0,  s.z, 0.0,
                            0.0,  0.0,  0.0, 1.0 );     // Scaling Matrix
			
			/** . . . **/
	
			void main(){
                /** . . . **/
                gl_Position = T * S * projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vPosition;
                /** . . . **/
            }
```

We can observe that  Scale (`S`)  and Translation (`T`)  are the last transformation applied to the model.



### Task 3

Define an orthographic projection with the planes near and far controlled by sliders.

#### Solution T3

See <u>Task1</u>.



#### Task 4

Split the window vertically into two parts. One shows the orthographic projection defined above, the second uses a perspective projection. The slider for near and far should work for both projections. Points 5 to 7 use the splitted window with two different projections.

#### Solution T4

We use  `gl.viewport ` and  `gl.scissor`  to split the canvas in two parts, one for each of the two projections views. With  `glScissor`  we define a rectangle, called *the scissor box*, in window coordinates. The first two arguments, *x* and *y*, specify the lower left corner of the box. *width* and *height* specify the width and height of the box.

```c
var render = function() {
    function renderScene(X, Y, width, height, projectionMatrix) {
        gl.enable(gl.SCISSOR_TEST);       // Only pixels that lie within the scissor
        gl.viewport(X, Y, width, height); // box can be modified by drawing; commands;
        gl.scissor(X, Y, width, height);  // Define the scissor box;
    	/**                   . . .                         **/    
        /** . . . usual render() content instructions . . . **/
    	/**                   . . .                         **/    
    }
    
    // Draw the left scene ( ORTHOGRAPHIC projection ):
    {
        projectionMatrix = ortho(left, right, bottom, ytop, zNear, zFar);
        gl.clearColor(1, 1, 1, 1);
    	renderScene(0, 0, width/2, height, projectionMatrix);
    }
    // Draw the right scene ( PERSPECTIVE projection ):
    {        
        const projectionMatrix  =  perspective(fovy, aspect, zNear, zFar);
        gl.clearColor(1, 1, 1, 1);
        renderScene(width/2, 0,  width/2, height, projectionMatrix);
    }
    requestAnimFrame(render);
}
```

So,  the two scenesâ€™ programs receives just  different projection matrixes.

>   The same near and far sliders are used to set both projections.
